abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and objectives for meaningful use have increased opportunities for data-driven predictive applications in healthcare. These decision support applications are often fueled by large-scale, heterogeneous, and multilevel (i.e., defined at hierarchical levels of specificity) patient data that challenge the development of predictive models. Our objective is to develop and evaluate an approach for optimally specifying multilevel patient data for prediction problems. We present a general evolutionary computational framework to optimally specify multilevel data to predict individual patient outcomes. We evaluate this method for both flattening (single level) and retaining the hierarchical predictor structure (multiple levels) using data collected to predict critical outcomes for emergency department patients across five populations. We find that the performance of both the flattened and hierarchical predictor structures in predicting critical outcomes for emergency department patients improve upon the baseline models for which only a single level of predictor—either more general or more specific—is used ( {\textless}math id="M1"{\textgreater} {\textless}mi{\textgreater}p{\textless}/mi{\textgreater} {\textless}mo{\textgreater}{\textless}{\textless}/mo{\textgreater} {\textless}mn{\textgreater}0.001{\textless}/mn{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater} ).

abstract = {Introduction: Attending physician judgment is the traditional standard of care for emergency department (ED) admission decisions. The extent to which variability in admission decisions affect cost and quality is not well understood. We sought to determine the impact of variability in admission decisions on cost and quality. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of patients presenting to a university-affiliated, urban ED from October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2008. The main outcome measures were admission rate, fiscal indicators (Medicaid-denied payment days), and quality indicators (15-and 30-day ED returns; delayed hospital admissions). We asked each Attending to estimate their inpatient admission rate and correlated their personal assessment with actual admission rates. Results: Admission rates, even after adjusting for known confounders, were highly variable (15.2{\%}-32.0{\%}) and correlated with Medicaid denied-payment day rates (p=0.038). There was no correlation with quality outcome measures (30-day ED return or delayed hospital admission). There was no significant correlation between actual and self-described admission rate; the range of mis-estimation was 0{\%} to 117{\%}. Conclusion: Emergency medicine attending admission rates at this institution are highly variable, unexplained by known confounding variables, and unrelated to quality of care, as measured by 30-day ED return or delayed hospital admission. Admission optimization represents an important untapped potential for cost reduction through avoidable hospitalizations, with no apparent adverse effects on quality.

abstract = {Individual physicians are widely believed to play a large role in patients' decisions about end-of-life care, but little empirical evidence supports this view.We developed a novel method for measuring the relationship between physician characteristics and hospice enrollment, in a nationally representative sample of Medicare patients. We focused on patients who died with a diagnosis of poor-prognosis cancer in the period 2006-11, for whom palliative treatment and hospice would be considered the standard of care. We found that the proportion of a physician's patients who were enrolled in hospice was a strong predictor of whether or not that physician's other patients would enroll in hospice. The magnitude of this association was larger than that of other known predictors of hospice enrollment that we examined, including patients' medical comorbidity, age, race, and sex. Patients cared for by medical oncologists and those cared for in not-for-profit hospitals were significantly more likely than other patients to enroll in hospice. These findings suggest that physician characteristics are among the strongest predictors of whether a patient receives hospice care-which mounting evidence indicates can improve care quality and reduce costs. Interventions geared toward physicians, both by specialty and by previous history of patients' hospice enrollment, may help optimize appropriate hospice use.},

abstract = {The misuse of opioids has become a national public health emergency in the United States. Successfully completing a program of treatment at a substance abuse treatment facility is associated with better long-term outcomes, but a significant portion of opioid use patients are discharged without successfully completing treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate factors associated with treatment success. We used the Treatment Episodes Datasets: Discharges (TEDS-D) dataset, a national sample of discharges from substance abuse treatment centers, and the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) dataset, an annual survey of all known substance use treatment facilities, for the years 2013 and 2014. A random slope, random intercept multilevel model was used to estimate the effects of patient- and state-level variables on treatment completion. We find that a patient is more likely to complete treatment if that patient is older, employed, has private insurance, waited less time before entering treatment, is not receiving medication-assisted treatment, and is in residential care. In addition, we find that patients living in with states with higher levels of Vivitrol adoption are more likely to complete treatment. Our findings could encourage policymakers and treatment facilities to consider prioritizing Vivitrol adoption. At the same time, our results demonstrate substantial variation of predictors across states and suggest the need for further research into the relationship between state contexts and the predictors of successful opioid use treatment.},

abstract = {In health care, multilevel models are typically used to evaluate hospitals' performance and to rank hospitals accordingly. While multilevel models capture the hierarchical structure in the data, such as the grouping of patients into hospitals, these models do not account for additional latent structures. In this paper, we develop a novel multilevel logistic cluster-weighted model which can predict a binary outcome, such as mortality within 30 days of discharge, while accounting both for known and latent structures of the data. We develop an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for parameter estimation and a parametric bootstrap approach for assessing the variability of the estimators. Using a rich data set of the Lombardy (Italy) health care system and focussing on the two wards of cardiosurgery and medicine, we show how the proposed model detects, in both cases, two well-defined clusters within the patient to hospital hierarchical structure of the data. A comparison with standard multilevel and cluster-weighted approaches reveals a better fit of the proposed model and a greater insight into the structure of the data. We show how this can have implications in the resulting league tables and thus how the proposed model can be a useful tool for policy-makers and healthcare managers to conduct hospital evaluations.},

abstract = {Objectives: The care of critically ill patients generates large quantities of data. Increasingly, these data are presented to the provider within an electronic medical record. The manner in which data are organized and presented can impact on the ability of users to synthesis that data into meaningful information. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that novel user interfaces, which prioritize the display of high-value data to providers within system-based packages, reduce task load, and result in fewer errors of cognition compared with established user interfaces that do not. Design: Randomized crossover study. Setting: Academic tertiary referral center. Subjects: Attending, resident and fellow critical care physicians. Interventions: Novel health care record user interface. Measurement: Subjects randomly assigned to either a standard electronic medical record or a novel user interface, were asked to perform a structured task. The task required the subjects to use the assigned electronic environment to review the medical record of an intensive care unit patient said to be actively bleeding for data that formed the basis of answers to clinical questions posed in the form of a structured questionnaire. The primary outcome was task load, measured using the paper version of the NASA-task load index. Secondary outcome measures included time to task completion, number of errors of cognition measured by comparison of subject to post hoc gold standard questionnaire responses, and the quantity of information presented to subjects by each environment. Main Results: Twenty subjects completed the task on eight patients, resulting in 160 patient-provider encounters (80 in each group). The standard electronic medical record contained a much larger data volume with a median (interquartile range) number of data points per patient of 1008 (895-1183) compared with 102 (77-112) contained within the novel user interface. The median (interquartile range) NASA-task load index values were 38.8 (32-45) and 58 (45-65) for the novel user interface compared with the standard electronic medical record (p {\textless} .001). The median (interquartile range) times in seconds taken to complete the task for four consecutive patients were 93 (57-132), 60 (48-71), 68 (48-80), and 54 (42-64) for the novel user interface compared with 145 (109-201), 125 (113-162), 129 (100-145), and 112 (92-123) for the standard interface (p {\textless} .0001), respectively. The median (interquartile range) number of errors per provider was 0.5 (0-1) and two (0.25-3) for the novel user interface and standard electronic medical record interface, respectively (p = .007). Conclusions: A novel user interface was designed based on the information needs of intensive care unit providers with a specific goal of development being the reduction of task load and errors of cognition associated with filtering, extracting, and using medical data contained within a comprehensive electronic medical record. The results of this simulated clinical experiment suggest that the configuration of the intensive care unit user interface contributes significantly to the task load, time to task completion, and number of errors of cognition associated with the identification, and subsequent use, of relevant patient data. Task-specific user interfaces, developed from an understanding of provider information requirements, offer advantages over interfaces currently available within a standard electronic medical record.

abstract = {Objectives: AWARE (Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation) is a novel electronic medical record (EMR) dashboard designed by clinicians to support bedside clinical information management in the ICU. AWARE sits on top of pre-existing, comprehensive EMR systems. The purpose of the study was to test the acceptance and impact of AWARE on data management in live clinical ICU settings. The primary outcome measure was observed efficiency of data utilization as determined by time spent in data gathering before morning rounds. Design: Step wedge cluster randomization trial. Setting: Four ICUs (surgical, medical, and mixed) at an academic referral center. Subjects: All members of the critical care team participating in morning ICU rounds. Intervention: Pilot implementation of a novel EMR interface with direct observation and survey. Measurements and main results: The study took place between April and July 2012. A total of 80 and 63 direct observations were made in the pre- and post-implementation study periods respectively. The time spent on pre-round data gathering per patient decreased from 12 (10-15) to 9 (7.3-11) min for pre- and post-implementation phases respectively (. p=. 0.03).Compared to the existing EMR, information management (data presentation format, efficiency of data access) was reported to be better after AWARE implementation. AWARE made the task of gathering data for rounds significantly less difficult and mentally demanding. Conclusions: The introduction of a novel, patient-centered EMR viewer for the ICU was associated with improved efficiency and ease of clinical data management compared to the standard EMR.},

abstract = {Background: Physicians' prior experiences caring for patients with breast cancer along with experiences in their social networks including family members and friends may be a key and understudied driver of recommendations for cancer screening. Methods: The Breast Cancer Social Networks study (CanSNET) is a national, mailed survey of 2,000 primary care providers (PCPs) randomly selected from the American Medical Association Masterfile. PCPs were asked to provide detailed characteristics on up to 2 women they know who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and “whose cancer, broadly speaking, had the greatest impact” on them, including friends, family members and patients. Each woman was categorized as being diagnosed (a) through screening with a good prognosis, (b) not through screening with a good prognosis, (c) through screening with a poor prognosis or (d) not through screening with a poor prognosis. We used a logistic regression model to assess the association between the network member and recommendations for routine screening mammograms to average‐risk women ages 75+, adjusting for provider and practice characteristics. Results: Overall 871 physicians responded to the survey yielding an adjusted response rate of 52.3{\%} (out of 1665 eligible). We found that 67{\%} of physicians recommended screening for women 75+. The sample reported on 762 patients, 378 family members and 476 other network members who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Ten percent of patients and 25.1{\%} of family members reported on died of their disease. In adjusted models, we found that physicians who reported on family members who did not receive a mammogram and had a poor prognosis were significantly more likely to recommend screening compared to those who did not (Odds Ratio 1.22, 95{\%} Confidence Interval 1.03, 1.43). Conclusions: Physicians' experiences with their social networks was linked to their breast cancer screening recommendations, underscoring the potential for information that is learned from social networks to differ from clinical guidelines and highlighting the need to address a broad array of influences in trying to reduce potential over‐screening in cancer.},

To address the possible correlation between multivariate longitudinal measures and time to terminal events (e.g., death and dropout), joint models that consist of a multilevel item response theory submodel and a survival submodel have been previously developed. However, in multisite studies, multiple patients are recruited and treated by the same clinical site. There can be a significant site correlation because of common environmental and socioeconomic status, and similar quality of care within site. In this article, we develop and study several hierarchical joint models with the hazard of terminal events dependent on shared random effects from various levels. We conduct extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of various models under different scenarios. The proposed hierarchical joint models are applied to the motivating deprenyl and tocopherol antioxidative therapy of Parkinsonism study to investigate the effect of tocopherol in slowing Parkinson's disease progression.},

abstract = {Purpose: While search engines have become nearly ubiquitous on the Web, electronic health records (EHRs) generally lack search functionality; furthermore, there is no knowledge on how and what healthcare providers search while using an EHR-based search utility. In this study, we sought to understand user needs as captured by their search queries. Methods: This post-implementation study analyzed user search log files for 6 months from an EHR-based, free-text search utility at our large academic institution. The search logs were de-identified and then analyzed in two steps. First, two investigators classified all the unique queries as navigational, transactional, or informational searches. Second, three physician reviewers categorized a random sample of 357 informational searches into high-level semantic types derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The reviewers were given overlapping data sets, such that two physicians reviewed each query. Results: We analyzed 2207 queries performed by 436 unique users over a 6-month period. Of the 2207 queries, 980 were unique queries. Users of the search utility included clinicians, researchers and administrative staff. Across the whole user population, approximately 14.5{\%} of the user searches were navigational searches and 85.1{\%} were informational. Within informational searches, we found that users predominantly searched for laboratory results and specific diseases. Conclusions: A variety of user types, ranging from clinicians to administrative staff, took advantage of the EHR-based search utility. Though these users' search behavior differed, they predominantly performed informational searches related to laboratory results and specific diseases. Additionally, a number of queries were part of words, implying the need for a free-text module to be included in any future concept-based search algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

First, negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA) are conceptualized as general factors shared by SIA and depression; the fear of negative evaluation (FNE) is operationalized as the specific factor, which accounts for more of the variance in SIA than in depression, and the fear of positive evaluation (FPE) is operationalized as the factor unique to SIA. FPE is the key feature that differentiates SIA from depression. Second, the proposed hierarchical model describes structural relationships among these factors, in which the higher-level factors (i.e., high NA and low PA) represent the vulnerability markers of both SIA and depression and the lower-level factors (i.e., FNE and FPE) are the dimensions of specific cognitive features. In addition, an alternative model, in which all of the relationships are the same, except that FPE is operationalized as a specific factor, is proposed to clarify the role of FPE. The results from the hierarchical regression and the structural equation modeling support the hypothesized hierarchical model. Further theoretical and practical implications for FPE and the multilevel model are discussed.},

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study is to describe the volume of clinical information documented in critical illness, its relationship to the use of intensive care unit (ICU) technology, and changes over time. Methods: We performed a 6-year retrospective cohort study. Eligible patients were admitted to a university-affiliated pediatric ICU for at least 24 hours during the years 2000 to 2005. For each complete 24-hour period (midnight-midnight) that each patient was admitted to the ICU, we extracted the total number of items of documented clinical information and the use of 5 ICU technologies. For each day of the study, we calculated the total volume of documented information available to inform the daily ward round. A 2-level hierarchical linear model was used to analyze the primary outcome variable. Main Measurements and Results: There were 5623 admissions and 41 202 complete patient-days studied. The median number of items of documented clinical data for each complete 24-hour period was 1348 (interquartile range, 1018-1664; mean, 1341). Significantly, more clinical information was documented about children who were ventilated with conventional ventilation (1483), children on inotropes or vasoactive medications (1685) and high-frequency oscillation (1726), and children receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (2354) or hemodialysis (1889) than children not in these categories (all P {\textless} .0001). The number of items documented per patient-day increased by 26{\%} from 1165 in 2000 to 1471 items in 2005 (P {\textless} .0001). This finding was independent of ICU technology use. Conclusions: A large and increasing volume of information was documented during the course of critical illness. More information was documented in patients receiving ICU technologies, suggesting that the volume of documented information is a marker of therapeutic intensity. It is also a source of workload and provides opportunity for error. Our findings underscore the importance of effective information management and communication strategies. Additional work is needed to evaluate the implications of current documentation practices for workload and quality of care. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Importance: Current electronic health records (EHRs) contribute to increased physician cognitive workload when completing clinical tasks. Objective: To assess the association of different design features of an EHR-based information visualization tool with the cognitive load of physicians during the clinical prioritization process. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included a convenience sample of 29 attending physicians at Seattle Children's Hospital, a large tertiary academic pediatric hospital. Data collection took place from August 2017 through October 2017, and analysis occurred from August to October 2018. Exposure: Physician participants used 3 prototypes with novel visualizations of simulated EHR data that highlighted 1 of 3 key patient characteristics, as follows: (1) acuity, (2) clinical problem list, and (3) clinical change. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cognitive workload was measured using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) scale (range, 1-100, with lower scores indicating lower cognitive workload). Cognitive workload was assessed for the 2 following clinical prioritization tasks: (1) finding information for a specific patient and (2) comparing results among patients for each prototype. Participants ranked 5 hypothetical patients from having the highest to the lowest priority in each design. Results: A total of 29 physician participants (15 [52{\%}] men; 14 [48{\%}] women; mean [range] age, 43 [35-58] years; mean [range] time in practice, 11 [3-30] years) completed the study. For task 1, the prototype highlighting clinical change was associated with lower median (interquartile range) NASA TLX scores compared with the prototype highlighting acuity (30.3 [15.2-41.6] vs 48.5 [18.7-59.3]; P = .02). For task 2, the prototype highlighting clinical change was associated with lower median (interquartile range) NASA TLX scores compared with the prototype highlighting the clinical problem list (29.1 [16.3-50.8] vs 43.5 [26.6-55.9]; P = .02). The prototype highlighting clinical change had the lowest TLX score in 17 of 29 rankings (59{\%}) for task 1 ($\chi$24 = 24.4; P {\textless} .001) and 18 of 29 rankings (62{\%}) for task 2 ($\chi$24 = 17.2; P = .002). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, well-designed EHR-based information visualizations that highlighted and featured clinically meaningful information patterns significantly reduced physician cognitive workload when prioritizing patient needs.},

District Level Household Survey-III (2007-08) data on delivery care and facility information was used for the purpose. Bivariate results examined the utilization pattern by states in presence of correlates of women related while a three-level hierarchical multilevel model illustrates the effect of accessibility, availability of health facility and community health program variables on the utilization of health services for institutional births. The study found a satisfactory improvement in state Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa, importantly, in Bihar and Uttaranchal. The study showed that increasing distance from health facility discouraged institutional births and there was a rapid decline of more than 50{\%} for institutional delivery as the distance to public health facility exceeded 10 km. Additionally, skilled female health worker (ANM) and observed improved public health facility led to significantly increase the probability of utilization as compared to non-skilled ANM and not-improved health centers. Adequacy of essential equipment/laboratory services required for maternal care significantly encouraged deliveries at public health facility. District/village variables neighborhood poverty was negatively related to institutional delivery while higher education levels in the village and women's residing in more urbanized districts increased the utilization. "Inter-district" variation was 14 percent whereas "between-villages" variation for the utilization was 11 percent variation once controlled for all the three-level variables in the model. This study suggests that the mere availability of health facilities is necessary but not sufficient condition to promote utilization until the quality of service is inadequate and inaccessible considering the inter-districts variation for the program implementation.},

@article{Andreae2018,
abstract = {BACKGROUND US health care disparities persist despite repeated countermeasures. Research identified race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status as factors, mediated through individual provider and/or systemic biases; little research exists in anesthesiology. We investigated antiemetic prophylaxis as a surrogate marker for anesthesia quality by individual providers because antiemetics are universally available, indicated contingent on patient characteristics (gender, age, etc), but independent of comorbidities and not yet impacted by regulatory or financial constraints. We hypothesized that socioeconomic indicators (measured as insurance status or median income in the patients' home zip code area) are associated with the utilization of antiemetic prophylaxis (as a marker of anesthesia quality). METHODS We tested our hypothesis in several subsets of electronic anesthesia records from the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry (NACOR), fitting frequentist and novel Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS NACOR contained 12 million cases in 2013. Six institutions reported on antiemetic prophylaxis for 441,645 anesthesia cases. Only 173,133 cases included details on insurance information. Even fewer (n = 92,683) contained complete data on procedure codes and provider identifiers. Bivariate analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and our Bayesian hierarchical model all showed a large and statistically significant association between socioeconomic markers and antiemetic prophylaxis (ondansetron and dexamethasone). For Medicaid versus commercially insured patients, the odds ratio of receiving the antiemetic ondansetron is 0.85 in our Bayesian hierarchical mixed regression model, with a 95{\%} Bayesian credible interval of 0.81-0.89 with similar inferences in classical (frequentist) regression models. CONCLUSIONS Our analyses of NACOR anesthesia records raise concerns that patients with lower socioeconomic status may receive inferior anesthesia care provided by individual anesthesiologists, as indicated by less antiemetics administered. Effects persisted after we controlled for important patient characteristics and for procedure and provider influences. Findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. Our results challenge the notion that anesthesia providers do not contribute to health care disparities.},

It draws on recent applications in health services research that have appeared in the literature. Methodological advances in these statistical techniques have taken place in the field of education, where empirical studies have mainly been concerned with comparing pupil achievement across different schools by exploring the relationship between individual and institutional factors. Although recent widespread availability of suitable software packages has enabled other disciplines to adopt these methods, to date they have received little attention in the health services research literature (the investigation of effects of geographical areas on health being a possible exception) despite their obvious application in many areas of current interest. Key areas that could benefit greatly from these techniques include the exploration of variations in clinical practice, comparisons of institutional performance and resource allocation.},

abstract = {Rationale: Variation in practice and outcomes, not explained by patient or illness characteristics, is common in health care, including in intensive care units (ICUs). Objective: To quantify within-ICU, between-physician variation in resource use in a single medical ICU. Methods: This was a prospective, noninterventional study in a medical ICU where nine intensivists provide care in 14-d rotations. Consecutive sample consisted of 1,184 initial patient admissions whose care was provided by a single intensivist. Multivariate models were constructed for average daily discretionary costs, ICU length of stay, and hospital mortality, adjusting for patient and illness characteristics , and workload. Measurements and Main Results: The identity of the intensivist was a significant predictor for average daily discretionary costs (p 0.0001), but not ICU length of stay (p 0.33) or hospital mortality (p 0.83). The intensivists had more influence on costs than all other variables except the severity and type of acute illness. Average daily discretionary costs varied by 43{\%} across the different intensiv-ists, equating to a mean difference of {\$}1,003 per admission between the highest and lowest terciles of intensivists. Conclusions: There are large differences among intensivists in the amount of resources they use to manage critically ill patients. Higher resource use was not associated with lower length of stay or mortality. Widespread variation in practice and outcomes is common in health care. However, we are not aware of any published reports that quantitatively address variation in ICU care attributable to individual intensivists. What This Study Adds to the Field We observed large differences among intensivists in the amount of resources they use to manage critically ill patients. It appears possible to reduce cost-inefficient variation by efforts to promote consistency of care across physicians. specifically attributed to the intensivists. We also hypothesized that intensivists cannot accurately judge the magnitude of resources they use in providing care. Some of the results of these studies have been previously reported in the form of an abstract (29). METHODS We prospectively collected these data in the 13-bed closed-model medical ICU of a 520-bed county-owned, university-affiliated teaching hospital between due to personnel limitations. The rotating ICU team comprises a board-certified intensivist, an ICU fellow, and five house officers who take overnight call on a 1-in-5 rotation. Nine intensivists assigned to 14-d intervals share ICU coverage. Neither the intensivist nor ICU fellow stays in the hospital overnight. More detailed information about the organization and functioning of this ICU is available in the online supplement. Multivariable linear or logistic models were constructed for average daily discretionary ICU costs, ICU length of stay (LOS), and hospital mortality. We log-transformed cost and LOS, and defined discretionary costs as including pharmacy, radiology (imaging and interventional), laboratories, blood bank, and echocardiography. We expressed costs obtained from the hospital's cost analysis system (Trendstar; McKesson Corporation, San Francisco, CA) as 2005 U.S. dollars. ICU LOS was measured in hours. Because transfer out of the ICU is often delayed due to limited ward bed availability, ICU LOS was defined as the interval from ICU admission until transfer was requested. To uniquely associate care with intensivists, we included patients only if the same intensivist was on duty each day of their ICU admission. To avoid erroneous mortality rates, we analyzed only initial admissions. The impact of the intensivists was assessed by including indicator variables in the models. Models included adjustments for demographics, comorbidities, type and severity of acute illness, invasive mechanical ventilation, the source of ICU admission, ICU workload, and any limitations placed on life-supporting therapies before ICU admission. Demo-graphics were age, sex, and race dichotomized into white versus nonwhite},

abstract = {Objective: To systematically review original user evaluations of patient information displays relevant to critical care and understand the impact of design frameworks and information presentation approaches on decision-making, efficiency, workload, and preferences of clinicians. Methods: We included studies that evaluated information displays designed to support real-time care decisions in critical care or anesthesiology using simulated tasks. We searched PubMed and IEEExplore from 1/1/1990 to 6/30/2018. The search strategy was developed iteratively with calibration against known references. Inclusion screening was completed independently by two authors. Extraction of display features, design processes, and evaluation method was completed by one and verified by a second author. Results: Fifty-six manuscripts evaluating 32 critical care and 22 anesthesia displays were included. Primary outcome metrics included clinician accuracy and efficiency in recognizing, diagnosing, and treating problems. Implementing user-centered design (UCD) processes, especially iterative evaluation and redesign, resulted in positive impact in outcomes such as accuracy and efficiency. Innovative display approaches that led to improved human-system performance in critical care included: (1) improving the integration and organization of information, (2) improving the representation of trend information, and (3) implementing graphical approaches to make relationships between data visible. Conclusion: Our review affirms the value of key principles of UCD. Improved information presentation can facilitate faster information interpretation and more accurate diagnoses and treatment. Improvements to information organization and support for rapid interpretation of time-based relationships between related quantitative data is warranted. Designers and developers are encouraged to involve users in formal iterative design and evaluation activities in the design of electronic health records (EHRs), clinical informatics applications, and clinical devices.},

Setting and participants A total of 22 392 patients with AMI, 8056 patients with HF and 17 161 patients with pneumonia were selected from 31 tertiary hospitals in Shanxi, China, from 2014 to 2015 using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. Patients were stratified by health insurance status, namely, urban employee-based basic medical insurance (UEBMI), urban resident-based basic medical insurance (URBMI), new cooperative medical scheme (NCMS) and self-payment. Outcome measures Inhospital mortality and length of stay (LOS). Results The highest unadjusted inhospital mortality rate was detected in NCMS patients independent of medical conditions (4.7{\%}, 4.4{\%} and 11.1{\%} for AMI, HF and pneumonia, respectively). The lowest unadjusted inhospital mortality rate and the longest LOS were observed in UEBMI patients. After controlling patient-level and hospital-level covariates, the adjusted inhospital mortality was significantly higher for NCMS and self-payment among patients with AMI, for NCMS among patients with HF and for URBMI, NCMS and self-payment among patients with pneumonia compared with UEBMI. The LOS of the URBMI, NCMS and self-payment groups was significantly shorter than that of the UEBMI group. Conclusion Insurance-related disparities in hospital care for patients with three common medical conditions were observed in this study. NCMS patients had significantly higher adjusted inhospital mortality and shorter LOS compared with UEBMI patients. Policies on minimising the disparities among different insurance schemes should be established by the government.},

abstract = {Background A detailed understanding of electronic health record (EHR) workflow patterns and information use is necessary to inform user-centered design of critical care information systems. While developing a longitudinal medical record visualization tool to facilitate electronic chart review (ECR) for medical intensive care unit (MICU) clinicians, we found inadequate research on clinician–EHR interactions. Objective We systematically studied EHR information use and workflow among MICU clinicians to determine the optimal selection and display of core data for a revised EHR interface. Methods We conducted a direct observational study of MICU clinicians performing ECR for unfamiliar patients during their routine daily practice at an academic medical center. Using a customized manual data collection instrument, we unobtrusively recorded the content and sequence of EHR data reviewed by clinicians. Results We performed 32 ECR observations among 24 clinicians. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) chart review duration was 9.2 (7.3–14.7) minutes, with the largest time spent reviewing clinical notes (44.4{\%}), laboratories (13.3{\%}), imaging studies (11.7{\%}), and searching/scrolling (9.4{\%}). Historical vital sign and intake/output data were never viewed in 31{\%} and 59{\%} of observations, respectively. Clinical notes and diagnostic reports were browsed 10 years in time for 60{\%} of ECR sessions. Clinicians viewed a median of 7 clinical notes, 2.5 imaging studies, and 1.5 diagnostic studies, typically referencing a select few subtypes. Clinicians browsed a median (IQR) of 26.5 (22.5–37.25) data screens to complete their ECR, demonstrating high variability in navigation patterns and frequent back-and-forth switching between screens. Nonetheless, 47{\%} of ECRs begin with review of clinical notes, which were also the most common navigation destination. Conclusion Electronic chart review centers around the viewing of clinical notes among MICU clinicians. Convoluted workflows and prolonged searching activities indicate room for system improvement. Using study findings, specific design recommendations to enhance usability for critical care information systems are provided.},

abstract = {Discrepancies between patient wishes and end-of-life treatment decisions have been documented, and the determinants of end-of-life treatment decisions are not well understood. Our objective was to understand hospital staff perceptions of the role of acute care hospital medical doctors in end-of-life treatment intensity. In 11 purposively sampled Pennsylvania hospitals, we completed 108 audiotaped semistructured interviews with key informants involved in decision making or discharge planning. Using grounded theory, we qualitatively analysed transcripts using constant comparison to identify factors affecting end-of-life treatment decisions. A predominant theme identified was that end-of-life treatment intensity depends on the doctor. Communication with patients and families and collaboration with other care team members also were reported to vary, contributing to treatment variation. Informants attributed physician variation to individual beliefs and attitudes regarding the end-of-life (religion and culture, determination of when a patient is dying, quality-of-life determination and fear of failing) and to socialization by and interaction with the healthcare system (training, role perception, experience and response to incentives). When end-of-life treatment depends on the doctor, patient and family preferences may be neglected. Targeted interventions may reduce variability and align end-of-life treatment with patient wishes.},

The analysis is based on 54,571 discharges, covering 11 medical and five surgical conditions, from nonfederal general hospitals in one state during 1988. Results suggest that both hospital and physician characteristics are important predictors of both outcome measures. Contrary to previous research, the volume of patients with the same condition treated by the hospital increases both length of stay and mortality. The volume of patients with the same condition treated by the physician increases length of stay among patients with medical conditions, decreases length of stay among those with surgical conditions, and decreases mortality. One interesting finding is that the medical school attended by the physician influences the patient's length of stay.

abstract = {model estimation of age-dependent individual-specific trajectories for left ventricular echocardiographic indexes in an asymptomatic elderly cohort.Few studies have been performed on the individual-specific trajectory of left ventricular aging as assessed by echocardiography in an asymptomatic elderly cohort. In the present study, a representative cohort of elderly men, who were long-term asymptomatic for cardiovascular issues, were selected from an ongoing observational aging study. Annual echocar-diographic data were used to establish an age-dependent hierarchical model. Based on two-level linear regression results, four echocardio-graphic indexes [left ventricular mass (LVmass; 1.872 g/yr), posterior ventricular wall thickness (0.048 mm/yr), fraction shortening (0.097/yr), and transmitral peak A velocity (0.006 m{\textperiodcentered}s 1 {\textperiodcentered}yr 1)] changed significantly with increasing age and were age-and subject-dependent. The most characterized results of the study were the significant, age-related, within-individual variances in echocardio-graphic results, which were observed using the likelihood ratio test at an occasion-dependent level. Of these, fluctuated amplitudes of two systolic variables [i.e., LVmass (con/age 0.012 0.004; P 0.0007) and fraction shortening (con/age 0.001 0.004; P 0.05)] were significantly attenuated with increasing age within individuals. On the other hand, the age-related variability of four diastolic Doppler variables [i.e., peak A velocity (con/age 0.003 0.002; P 0.0009), peak E velocity (con/age 0.004 0.003; P 0.01), E/A ratio (con/age 0.007 0.003; P 0.0002), and deceleration time of E wave (con/age 0.025 0.007; P 0.0001)] significantly increased with increasing age within individuals. The age-related individual variability of left ventricular indexes observed in this continuous asymptomatic cohort may reflect the mechanism of pre-clinical, individualized heart aging. In conclusion, successfully fitted multilevel models were applied as a valuable tool to determine the mechanism of individual cardiac aging in the elderly. asymptomatic; echocardiogram; cardiac ageing; individual variability; multilevel model DESPITE THE ACKNOWLEDGED IMPORTANCE of age in the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with the burgeoning elderly population, how the heart ages while failing remains largely unknown. For example, conventional population average analysis has indicated that left ventricular dia-stolic indexes are age dependent in the adult population but do not remain age dependent in the elderly, and this difference is attributed to great between-individual variation among the elderly (24). The oldest age group in men showed a uniquely prevalent manner-based population finding (16). Meta-analysis suggested an indefinite increase in mortality by active antihy-pertensive therapy in very elderly patients more than 80 yr of age (7). One important reason for this finding is the formidable between-individual heterogeneity in the aged population, which is associated with multiple cardiovascular risks and multi-morbidity. In addition to the ubiquitously used individual medication for cardiovascular prevention and therapy (9), another issue emerged, specifically that the use of efficient patient-centered medication challenges conventional statistics and requires adjustment for between-individual variances. This complicated dilemma may be mirrored by the considerable prevalence of asymptomatic elderly cardiovascular patients (6, 9, 11, 13, 20). Approximately one-half of heart failure patients have been shown to be asymptomatic with preserved ejection fraction or preclinical diastolic dysfunction (6, 9, 11, 13, 20), yet the mechanism behind the progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic diastolic dysfunction is entirely unclear. Therefore , individual-based external regulation and protection have elevated the within-individual heterogeneity of heart aging and failure. Meanwhile, the human lifespan is increasing, which further augments the complexity of age-related heart decline. It is very difficult to disentangle the complicated interrelationship among cardiac physiological aging, pathological heart failure, and external cardiovascular protection using conventional statistics. Conventional statistical analysis has limited applicability in such studies because the mathematical coupling dilemma created by high within-individual variance means that changes from baseline values cannot be simply related or regressed to values measured at later time points. Multilevel modeling has resolved this problem by simultaneously dealing with complex error structures and additional covariates and/or potential con-founders (2).In the present study, we used hierarchical model-ing, an advanced statistical technique, to trace age-related individual heart aging as assessed by longitudinal echocardio-graphic parameters in a representative aged cohort who were continuously asymptomatic. METHODS Longitudinal project on witnessing aging. Our cohort of continuously asymptomatic elderly men was selected from those who had taken part in the Longitudinal Project on Witnessing Aging (LPWA) in our Geriatrics Department. The LPWA was a single-center, longitudinal , observational cohort study. These elderly participants were qualified by the local government and assigned to be intensively treated, medicated, and followed up longitudinally in our department from age 60 years onward. Extensive biannual health assessments were performed according to a routine protocol. In the project, all male participants were observed and followed up from enrollment until death. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The project received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine at Harbin Medical University in accordance with the ethical standard outlined in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.},

abstract = {Objective. To compare expert-generated textual summaries of physiological data with trend graphs, in terms of their ability to support neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff in making decisions when presented with medical scenarios. Methods. Forty neonatal ICU staff were recruited for the experiment, eight from each of five groups - Junior, intermediate and senior nurses, junior and senior doctors. The participants were presented with medical scenarios on a computer screen, and a sked to choose from a list of 18 possible actions those they thought were appropriate. Half of the scenarios were presented as trend graphs, while the other half were presented as passages of text. The textual summaries had been generated by two human experts and were intended to describe the physiological state of the patient over a short period of time (around 40 minutes) but not to interpret it. Results. In terms of the content of responses there was a clear advantage for the Text condition, with participants tending to choose more of the appropriate actions when the information was presented as text rather than as graphs. In terms of the speed of response there was no difference between the Graphs and Text conditions. There was no significant difference between the staff groups in terms of speed or content of responses. In contrast to the objective measures of performance, the majority of participants reported a subjective preference for the Graphs condition. Conclusions. In this experimental task, participants performed better when presented with a textual summary of the medical scenario than when it was presented as a set of trend graphs. If the necessary algorithms could be developed that would allow computers automatically to generate descriptive summaries of physiological data, this could potentially be a useful feature of decision support tools in the intensive care unit. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract = {Objective Inefficient navigation in electronic health records has been shown to increase users' cognitive load, which may increase potential for errors, reduce efficiency, and increase fatigue. However, navigation has received insufficient recognition and attention in the electronic health record (EHR) literature as an independent construct and contributor to overall usability. Our aims in this literature review were to (1) assess the prevalence of navigation-related topics within the EHR usability and safety research literature, (2) categorize types of navigation actions within the EHR, (3) capture relationships between these navigation actions and usability principles, and (4) collect terms and concepts related to EHR navigation. Our goal was to improve access to navigation-related research in usability. Materials and methods We applied scoping literature review search methods with the assistance of a reference librarian to identify articles published since 1996 that reported evaluation of the usability or safety of an EHR user interface via user test, analytic methods, or inspection methods. The 4336 references collected from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Engineering Village, and expert referrals were de-duplicated and screened for relevance, and navigation-related concepts were abstracted from the 21 articles eligible for review using a standard abstraction form. Results Of the 21 eligible articles, 20 (95{\%}) mentioned navigation in results and discussion of usability evaluations. Navigation between pages of the EHR was the more frequently documented type of navigation (86{\%}) compared to navigation within a single page (14{\%}). Navigation actions (e.g., scrolling through a medication list) were frequently linked to specific usability heuristic violations, among which flexibility and efficiency of use, recognition rather than recall, and error prevention were most common. Discussion Discussion of navigation was prevalent in results across all types of evaluation methods among the articles reviewed. Navigating between multiple screens was frequently identified as a usability barrier. The lack of standard terminology created some challenges to identifying and comparing articles. Conclusion We observed that usability researchers are frequently capturing navigation-related issues even in articles that did not explicitly state navigation as a focus. Capturing and synthesizing the literature on navigation is challenging because of the lack of uniform vocabulary. Navigation is a potential target for normative recommendations for improved interaction design for safer systems. Future research in this domain, including development of normative recommendations for usability design and evaluation, will be facilitated by development of a standard terminology for describing EHR navigation.},

abstract = {Importance: The electronic health record (EHR) is a source of practitioner dissatisfaction in part because of challenges with information retrieval. To improve data accessibility, a better understanding of practitioners' information needs within individual patient records is needed. Objective: To assess EHR users' searches using data from a large integrated health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cross-sectional analysis used EHR search data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health care delivery system with more than 4.4 million members. Users' EHR search activity data were obtained from April 1, 2018, to May 15, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Search term frequency was grouped by user and practitioner types. Network analyses were performed of co-occurring search terms within a single search episode, and centrality measures for search terms (degree and betweenness centrality) were calculated. Results: A total of 12 313 047 search activities (including 4 328 330 searches and 7 984 717 result views) conducted by 34 735 unique users within 977 160 unique patient EHRs were identified. In aggregate, users searched for 208 374 unique search terms and conducted a median of 4 searches (interquartile range, 1-28 searches). Of all 97 367 active EHR users, 34 735 (35.7{\%}) conducted at least 1 search. However, of all 12 968 active EHR physician users, 9801 (75.6{\%}) conducted at least 1 search, and of all 1908 active pharmacist users, 1402 (73.5{\%}) conducted at least 1 search. The top 3 most commonly searched terms were statin (75 017 searches [1.7{\%}]), colonoscopy (73 545 [1.7{\%}]), and pft (54 990 [1.3{\%}]). However, wide variation in top searches were noted across practitioner groups. Terms searched most often with another term in a single linked search episode included statin, lisinopril, colonoscopy, gabapentin, and aspirin. Conclusions and Relevance: Although physicians and pharmacists were the most active users of EHR searches, search volume and frequently searched terms varied considerably by and within user role. Further customization of the EHR interface may help leverage users' search content and patterns to improve targeted information retrieval.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between the usability of an EHR system for the management of abnormal test results and physicians' cognitive workload and performance levels. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study was conducted in a simulated EHR environment. From April 1, 2016, to December 23, 2016, residents and fellows from a large academic institution were enrolled and allocated to use either a baseline EHR (n = 20) or an enhanced EHR (n = 18). Data analyses were conducted from January 9, 2017, to March 30, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: The EHR with enhanced usability segregated in a dedicated folder previously identified critical test results for patients who did not appear for a scheduled follow-up evaluation and provided policy-based decision support instructions for next steps. The baseline EHR displayed all patients with abnormal or critical test results in a general folder and provided no decision support instructions for next steps. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cognitive workload was quantified subjectively using NASA-Task Load Index and physiologically using blink rates. Performance was quantified according to the percentage of appropriately managed abnormal test results. RESULTS: Of the 38 participants, 25 (66{\%}) were female. The 20 participants allocated to the baseline EHR compared with the 18 allocated to the enhanced EHR demonstrated statistically significantly higher cognitive workload as quantified by blink rate (mean [SD] blinks per minute, 16 [9] vs 24 [7]; blink rate, -8 [95{\%} CI, -13 to -2]; P = .01). The baseline group showed statistically significantly poorer performance compared with the enhanced group who appropriately managed 16{\%} more abnormal test results (mean [SD] performance, 68{\%} [19{\%}] vs 98{\%} [18{\%}]; performance rate, -30{\%} [95{\%} CI, -40{\%} to -20{\%}]; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Relatively basic usability enhancements to the EHR system appear to be associated with better physician cognitive workload and performance; this finding suggests that next-generation systems should strip away non-value-added EHR interactions, which may help physicians eliminate the need to develop their own suboptimal workflows.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of the future trajectory of a disease is an important challenge in personalized medicine and population health management. However, many complex chronic diseases exhibit large degrees of heterogeneity, and furthermore there is not always a single readily available biomarker to quantify disease severity. Even when such a clinical variable exists, there are often additional related biomarkers that may help improve prediction of future disease state. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic generative model for multivariate longitudinal data that captures dependencies between multivariate trajectories of clinical variables. We use a Gaussian process based regression model for each individual trajectory, and build off ideas from latent class models to induce dependence between their mean functions. We develop a scalable variational inference algorithm that we use to fit our model to a large dataset of longitudinal electronic patient health records. Our model's dynamic predictions have significantly lower errors compared to a recent state of the art method for modeling disease trajectories, and they are being incorporated into a population health rounding tool to be used by clinicians at our local accountable care organization.},

abstract = {There is a widespread view held by health clinicians that their work effectiveness is impaired by 'information overload.' Building upon a previous work by Wilson, a review of the literature was undertaken to look for the evidence of this. It was found that the literature, particularly in the context of the clinical environment, was limited. This review explores the diverse overarching theories of information overload, effects of the phenomenon that are perceived to occur and proposed solutions to this problem. Many of the papers noted an information explosion but only three authors explicitly attempted to measure both the quantity and the complexity of this information. It was also found that the typology of the information studied was severely limited with most studies exploring information such as guidelines, access to journals, research findings and other knowledge intensive areas. Solutions proposed seem to concentrate on technological means rather than exploring the use of humans either in management of information or as a step in the filtering process.},

@techreport{Correia-Gomes2012,
abstract = {Background: The EU Regulation No 2160/2003 imposes a reduction in the prevalence of Salmonella in pigs. The efficiency of control programmes for Salmonella in pigs, reported among the EU Member States, varies and definitive eradication seems very difficult. Control measures currently recommended for Salmonella are not serotype-specific. Is it possible that the risk factors for different Salmonella serotypes are different? The aim of this study was to investigate potential risk factors for two groups of Salmonella sp serotypes using pen faecal samples from breeding pig holdings representative of the Portuguese pig sector. Methods: The data used come from the Baseline Survey for the Prevalence of Salmonella in breeding pigs in Portugal. A total of 1670 pen faecal samples from 167 herds were tested, and 170 samples were positive for Salmonella. The presence of Salmonella in each sample (outcome variable) was classified in three categories: i) no Salmonella, ii) Salmonella Typhimurium or S. Typhimurium-like strains with the antigenic formula: 1,4,5,12:i:-, , and iii) other serotypes. Along with the sample collection, a questionnaire concerning herd management and potential risk factors was utilised. The data have a "natural" hierarchical structure so a categorical multilevel analysis of the dataset was carried out using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, implemented in the software WinBUGS. Results: The significant associations found (when compared to category "no Salmonella"), for category "serotype Typhimurium or S. Typhimurium-like strains with the antigenic formula: 1,4,5,12:i:-" were: age of breeding sows, size of the herd, number of pigs/pen and source of semen. For the category "other serotypes" the significant associations found were: control of rodents, region of the country, source of semen, breeding sector room and source of feed.},

Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.},

abstract = {Purpose: To critically analyze physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making in intensive care. Methods: An ethical analysis of factors contributing to physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making. Results: There is variability in decision-making about life support, both within and between intensive care units. Physician age, race, religion, attitude to risk, and personality factors have been associated with decisions to provide or limit life-sustaining treatment, though it is unclear how much these factors affect patient outcome. Inconsistency in decision-making appears worryingly arbitrary, and may mean that patients' values are sometimes being ignored or overridden. However, physician influence on decisions may also sometimes be appropriate and unavoidable, particularly where patient values are unclear. Conclusions: We argue that, although physician-related variability in end-of-life care can never be eliminated entirely, it is potentially ethically problematic. We outline four potential strategies for reducing the "roster lottery." {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ESICM.},

abstract = {Objective: The study measured whether nurses' situation awareness would increase and task completion time decrease when they used an integrated information display compared to traditional displays for medication management, patient awareness and team communication. Setting: The Burn Trauma Intensive Care Unit (BTICU) at the University Hospital, University of Utah Health Science Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Participants: 12 experienced BTICU nurses. Measures: Situation awareness (accuracy of the participants' answer) and task completion time (response time from seeing the question to submitting the answer) were measured using paper prototypes of both displays. Study design: Counter-balanced (on display order), repeated-measures design. Main results: Nurses had a higher situation awareness when using the integrated display, with an overall accuracy of 85.3{\%} compared to 61.8{\%} with the traditional displays (odds ratio 3.61, P {\textless} .001, 95{\%} CI = 2.34...5.57). Task completion times were nearly half with integrated displays compared to traditional displays (median 26.0 and 42.1 s, hazard ratio 2.31, P {\textless} .001, CI = 1.83...2.93). Conclusions: An integrated ICU information display increased nurses' situation awareness and decreased task completion time. Information integration has the potential to decrease errors, increase nurses' productivity and may allow nurses to react faster to a patient's clinical needs. Bidirectional device communication is needed for these displays to achieve full potential in improving patient safety. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {For psychiatric diseases, rich information exists in the serial measurement of mental health symptom scores. We present a precision medicine framework for using the trajectories of multiple symptoms to make personalized predictions about future symptoms and related psychiatric events. Our approach fits a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimates a population-average trajectory for all symptoms and individual deviations from the average trajectory, then fits a second model that uses individual symptom trajectories to estimate the risk of experiencing an event. The fitted models are used to make clinically relevant predictions for new individuals. We demonstrate this approach on data from a study of antipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia, predicting future scores for positive, negative, and general symptoms, and the risk of treatment failure in 522 schizophrenic patients with observations over 8 weeks. While precision medicine has focused largely on genetic and molecular data, the complementary approach we present illustrates that innovative analytic methods for existing data can extend its reach more broadly. The systematic use of repeated measurements of psychiatric symptoms offers the promise of precision medicine in the field of mental health.},

abstract = {Using the 2002 World Health Survey, we examine the association between welfare state regimes, gender and mental health among 26 countries classified into seven distinct regimes: Conservative, Southeast Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, Liberal, Southern/Ex-dictatorship, and Social Democratic. A two-level hierarchical model found that the odds of experiencing a brief depressive episode in the last 12 months was significantly higher for Southern/Ex- dictatorship countries than for Southeast Asian (odds ratio (OR) = 0.12, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.05-0.27) and Eastern European (OR = 0.36, 95{\%} CI 0.22-0.58) regimes after controlling for gender, age, education, marital status, and economic development. In adjusted interaction models, compared to Southern/Ex-dictatorship males (reference category), the odds ratios of depression were significantly lower among Southeast Asian males (OR = 0.16, 95{\%} CI 0.08-0.34) and females (OR = 0.23, 95{\%} CI 0.10-0.53) and Eastern European males (OR = 0.41, 95{\%} CI 0.26-0.63) and significantly higher among females in Liberal (OR = 2.00, 95{\%} CI 1.14-3.49) and Southern (OR = 2.42, 95{\%} CI 1.86-3.15) regimes.

abstract = {Background: Electronic medical record (EMR) systems need functionality that decreases cognitive overload by drawing the clinician's attention to the right data, at the right time. We developed a Learning EMR (LEMR) system that learns statistical models of clinician information-seeking behavior and applies those models to direct the display of data in future patients. We evaluated the performance of the system in identifying relevant patient data in intensive care unit (ICU) patient cases. Methods: To capture information-seeking behavior, we enlisted critical care medicine physicians who reviewed a set of patient cases and selected data items relevant to the task of presenting at morning rounds. Using patient EMR data as predictors, we built machine learning models to predict their relevancy. We prospectively evaluated the predictions of a set of high performing models. Results: On an independent evaluation data set, 25 models achieved precision of 0.52, 95{\%} CI [0.49, 0.54] and recall of 0.77, 95{\%} CI [0.75, 0.80] in identifying relevant patient data items. For data items missed by the system, the reviewers rated the effect of not seeing those data from no impact to minor impact on patient care in about 82{\%} of the cases. Conclusion: Data-driven approaches for adaptively displaying data in EMR systems, like the LEMR system, show promise in using information-seeking behavior of clinicians to identify and highlight relevant patient data.},

A better EMR would provide concise, context sensitive patient data, but doing so entails the difficult task of knowing which data are relevant. To determine the relevance of patient data in different contexts, we collect and model the information seeking behavior of clinicians using a learning EMR (LEMR) system. Sufficient data were collected to train predictive models for 80 different targets (e.g., glucose level, heparin administration) and 27 of them had AUROC values of greater than 0.7. These results are encouraging considering the high variation in information seeking behavior (intraclass correlation 0.40). We plan to apply these models to a new set of patient cases and adapt the LEMR interface to highlight relevant patient data, and thus provide concise, context sensitive data.},
